This is Bob.

Bob never clicks on any suspicous links that he sees online. Bob owns a VPN subscription, and he is super careful when he uses the internet.

How many people do you know who are like Bob? People who;
think they are safe online as long as they "don't click any random links or download and run random potentially dangerous files".

Remember when [Twitter was hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Twitter_account_hijacking) in 2020 and the hackers pulled the most unoriginal, shittiest heist ever... the crypto flip scam?

This is all (social engineering)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)]. 

Why perform recon to obtain data to aid in compromising a system via a vulnerability when you can perform [OSINT](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/open-source-intelligence-osint/#:~:text=Open%20Source%20Intelligence%20(OSINT)%20is,national%20intelligence%20agencies%2C%20or%20cybercriminals) on the target individual/company, launch a [spear phishing](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/campaign/Counterintelligence_Tips_Spearphishing.pdf) attack with a burner phone number, and gain access to systems that way?

Works majority of the time.
