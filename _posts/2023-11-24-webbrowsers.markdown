2 years ago I started using [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) for simple reasons.

1. I wanted something fast.
2. I wanted something that just works.
3. I didn't care about privacy/security.

The reality behind picking a web browser is you have to go all out. You can't use Firefox for privacy and then use Google as your search engine. 

That's pointless.

The debate since the beginning of time has been "Google Chrome of Firefox???"

With newer browsers gaining popularity (mainly Brave & Opera), it is giving people more of a reason to bandwagon their favorite browser. 

Did you know that most browsers are just Chromium forks?

Every popular browser currently other than Firefox is Chromium based. 

This means the developers built on top of Chromium to make their own forked browser. All of the Brave users who think they have top tier privacy and security in reality do not since they are using a browser that isn't de-googled. You have better privacy and security, yeah, but you're still using a Chromium fork and giving Google your data. One of the reasons Brave is labeled a "privacy friendly" or a "security friendly" browser is due to the fact that it is open-sourced, just like the browser it's based on (Chromium). 

Brave also has security/privacy friendly features baked into the browser by default, such as: 

* blocking trackers
* prevents fingerprinting via user-agent
* potentially preventing phishing attempts

This leads many to believe Brave is more privacy friendly out of the box than Firefox, and at the end of the day that answer ultimately comes down to your definition of "privacy".

From a technical perspective this theory is incorrect as it is still a Chromium fork at the end of the day and you're better off configuring a Firefox install to mirror the benefits of Brave. There is nothing that Brave does that cannot be done on a Firefox instance, and many of these features can be [modified directly on the Firefox engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxWXLlfqNAo&t) using about:config. Extensions can do the rest, such as uBlock Origin and a user-agent randomizer extension.

A modified Firefox instance with the proper settings and extensions is the route if you want privacy and security. If you don't, then any other browser will work.

Think of every browser as a bloated version of Chromium, because that's literally what they are; a Chromium fork with extra features.

Opera has more of a "gamer" appeal to it and attempts to be the Swiss army knife of web browsers, bloated with a bunch of random features that you will never use.

Brave has more of a privacy/security appeal, and does a pretty good job for the most part (other than being a Chromium fork).

I will not be covering other Chromium based browsers in this post as they're not very popular, other than Edge but nobody uses Edge.

## Chromium & Google Chrome

I advise to just use Chromium if you're looking for something reliable and fast and privacy isn't a concern. Chromium looks and feels exactly like Google Chrome. Chromium & Chrome are both pretty "secure", Google knows what they're doing for the most part when it comes to security. Chrome fans are better off using Chromium as it's literally what Chrome is but without the propriety garbage. You know what code is running on your system and it's less bloated. Chromium *has to be* a good foundation.

Chromium has to be:

* realible
* fast
* well maintained

This should come as no surprise, right? Chromium is what most browsers are built upon. Developers have to trust Chromium as the foundation for their project.

Chromium & Chrome are both good options when it comes to speed because Chromium is known as a browser foundation, and Chrome is the most popular web browser in the world. Popularity = well maintained and fast browser for end-user convenience.

Google owns the most popular Web browser *AND* the most popular search engine in the world. This allows their browsers to be extremely "compatible", efficient, and fast as it's all the same ecosytem of tech.

The Google search engine is also the best search engine for consistent results. Google by far gives the best results of all search engines in terms of consistency, accuracy, etc.. This is due to the popularity of the search engine. The Google search engine is arguably the most popular piece of software ever created. This grants the Google search engine a huge advantage over other search engines as it has more information generated into the algorithm. 

Picking a search engine to use is just deciding what neural network you want to use. What network had more time to develop with more data fed into the algorithm? What network has more advanced AI that won't feed you awful results (*cough* Bing).

The only reason I can think of for why someone may use Chrome over Chromium is if they: 

1. Don't know what Chromium is
2. They don't know how to install Chromium

Also: Chrome extensions work on Chromium.

## Brave 

There isn't a whole lot to discuss about Brave as I already covered its selling points.

Key takeaways: 

* fork of Chromium 
* Has features built in by default that are privacy & security friendly
* just use a well configured Firefox install instead, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxWXLlfqNAo&t), as well as [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0kl6t7U7K4&t)
* if you want privacy but you're "too lazy" to custom configure a Firefox install, then use Brave... just know it won't be as privacy friendly as if you custom configured a firefox install 

## Opera 

If you like feature rich web browsers that are still relatively fast compared to Chrome/Chromium, Opera is great. Just know that Opera is more of a niche browser and not many people use it compared to Chrome, Chromium, & Firefox. Most of the hype, support, functionality, will be with Google Chrome and Firefox.

## Bandwagoning/gatekeeping web browsers

I am going to end with this. 

The dumbest thing you can do is bandwagon a particular browser or gatekeep other browsers that aren't "your personal favorite". Especially if you use Google Chrome. Not saying you can't use Chrome, of course, but understand that you use Chrome because you don't know better about anything else. Which again, IS FINE... but don't hate on people who use other web browsers as if you know the differences regardles. You don't. If your reason for disliking a browser boils down to "who even uses that browser??", then you're missing the whole fucking point. 

There are people different than you who have different needs than you. Hence why these various browsers were created for other people. If everyone was like you, everyone would just use Google Chrome!!!! I know that's not a hard concept to grasp but you'd be shocked with how many idiots are online that can't grasp simple shit, and these are the people who make fun of person "X" for using web browser "Y" just because it's not Google Chrome.
