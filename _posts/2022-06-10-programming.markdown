Giving a computer instructions on what to do grants the power to do anything in the world. You'd think this task would be hard. Programming isn't hard, it's time consuming.

Many over-analyze programming and get the wrong idea. They'll look up to a successful programmer and note down their path to success. They will then imitate that path and will be shocked when it doesn't return the same results. Imposter syndrome will kick in, they lose motivation, and they quit. This is how many start their journey into programming.

Copying other people is not a good way to learn anything. Everybody is different and will have different goals and preferences. What works for one person may not work for you. You can still get ideas or inspiration from others, but don't think copying others will result in success just because they're successful. They got there with genuine interest, motivation, and an ounce of luck. It won't be different for you.

Learn to be self reliant and understand what works for you. Attempting to artificially alter your unique style of you, to someone who is not you.. will end up with poor results. Stop trying to use a cheat code that doesn't exist. There aren't any. 

Eliminating these issues (if you suffered from them in the first place) is a great starting point to learn programming or anything in life. I see this way too often.

# How to learn programming

If you're an absolute beginner, then a few YouTube videos introducing you to your programming language of choice won't hurt. You obviously have to learn the basics somehow. Just make sure you don't end up having to rely on YouTube videos for absolutely everything and learn how to use other resources such as Google, etc.. If you follow along to a tutorial, make sure to alter your code a little so that you learn to be more self reliant, instead of just literally copying every line of code.

After you learn the basics (if statements, booleans, variables, etc.) then:

Fuck paid courses and coding bootcamps. They are a waste of time and just want your money. Granted they will teach you the basics of programming and will make you feel like you got your moneys worth by showing you how to code a few worthless programs that you'll never use, but it will be a whole hell of a lot easier and more fun to just simply learn the basics yourself while simultaneously creating something you like. If you're not having fun with it then you're likely going to get demotivated from the start and quit altogether. Watching an 8 hour C++ introduction video on YouTube while falling asleep at your keyboard writing the most boring program in the world is more of a chore than anything. Why would you subject yourself to that? Most people will open an 8 hour long YouTube video, only watch the parts they find interesting, half ass pay attention, and then click off after 5 minutes. Wow, so much value! Even if you properly, efficiently, and responsibily follow the course and spend an hour of every day to get on a schedule, you just spent 8 days of your life for little value in return. 

Long courses jam everything into a video or a video series, which will typically be overwhelming and your average person isn't going to watch it all the way through and efficiently memorize everything that was taught in the video. Out of that 8 hour video for example, you're probably only going to remember an hour of content. You're not really getting the bang for your buck, or the bang for your time.. if it's free. 

Again, even if you do spread out your time to create short study sessions to learn everything, you could have instead spent that time creating the program you've always wanted while learning on the way. This is a lot more efficient as you're creating something you're passionate about and it's something you genuinely want to make. You're way more likely to memorize things you learn if you're having fun in the process. It's also more efficient in every way to put your newly learned skills to the test making something you enjoy, rather than a calculator or something equally as boring.

Pick a programming language, learn it, think of something you want to program, and then do it. 

Like I stated above, many over-analyze programming. Stop thinking so hard about it and just calm the fuck down and do it.  

After you learn the basics of your first language, learning additional languages will be much easier. For example, they all have if statements, booleans, and while loops. The only difference is the syntax of how these different functions are written in code. How you write a while loop in C# will be different than most other languages. The other reason as to why additional languages will be much easier to learn is due to the fact that you're already aware of the majority of programming terminology. You already know what an if statement is, variables, what they do, etc... you just need to know how to write them in your new language. 

There are many languages that are great for certain things and not so great for other things. This means you need to be careful while picking a language depending on what you're wanting to program.

If you want to build a game in python, don't go to YouTube and type "how to build a game in python" and then copy each line of code one by one. You're not learning anything that way, you're just copying the code without knowing what any of it does. Also, Java and the C languages are way better for game development.

The proper way to learn how to program something is by breaking up the process into multiple pieces. Let's say you want to learn how to write a bash script on your linux system that automatically starts an application upon booting your computer. Start by learning how to create a bash script, and then learn how to start an application with bash. You can always just Google "linux bash script to start an application on boot" and copy/paste the code, but you're likely going to walk away not learning anything. If you're going to be putting in the time, might as well learn with that time. Granted you're probably going to forget the code in 5 minutes, it's hard to remember everything, but at the very least make sure you understand the code and what it does prior to using it. If you continuously put in a minute or two to understand the code before using it, aside from just copy/pasting it, you will get better with understanding code syntax over time.

## Reality Check 

Many newly developed programmers have the misconception that programmers write code nonstop every second of the day. This is the farthest from the truth. The vast majority of programming is researching ideas, learning a particular framework, API, library, etc., and then planning what code they're actually going to write as well as how to write it. You are not playing typeracer in your IDE/text editor like you're in the matrix. 

You're also going to run into issues regardless of how experienced of a progammer you are. You will need to call out to the internet for help every now and then, especially if you're a beginner. You will either run your code and your debugger spits out an error, or your program runs without any errors but your code doesn't perform the expected actions. You will need to research why this is. This doesn't mean you're a bad programmer, this just means you're putting in the effort to learn instead of quitting your project.

#### Is your lack of knowledge your fault?

Having the skillset to know if it's your fault for lacking knowledge in a particular area is going to be critical to help prevent imposter syndrome. For example, if you simply forgot the syntax on how to declare a variable and initialize its value, this is a small mistake that an easy Google search can fix. This means you weren't paying that close attention when you initially were learning the basics of your language. This is obviously your fault, but don't let that upset you as it doesn't matter. At least you know now. Having the mental awareness to tell yourself "who cares" instead of getting all pissy and throwing a tantrum will increase the longevity of your programming journeys. Programming isn't a race or competition. Your objective should be to learn. Programming should never feel like a rushed project as you're learning it on your own time.
